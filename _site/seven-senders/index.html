  <h3>Why I joined Seven Senders</h3>
  <p>After the closing of the Westwing Berlin office, I needed to find a new challenge. I discoved Seven Senders via my previous manager <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/wolf-winter-59250122/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wolf Winter</a>, they needed a Product Owner to support their carrier delivery analytics product. I knew part of the logistic world via my experience at <a href="../../westwing/index.html">Westwing</a> and I was eager to expand my knowledge further in the logistic world.</p>

    <dt>Launch of Sendwise</dt>
    <dd>
      <p>In 6 months we launched <a href="https://software.sevensenders.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sendwise</a>, the new version of the previous product called <em>Analytics</em>. <em>Analytics</em> was a pure <abbr title="Personal Home Page or PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</abbr> application, with Sendwise we introduced a <a href="https://reactjs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">React</a> front-end on top of the <em>Analytics</em> back-end.</p>
      <p>Sendwise allow the creation of an unlimited amount of tracking pages that you can customize to your needs. You can also customize all emails send to the customers via the application.</p>

    </dd>
    <dt>Carrier messages notifications</dt>
    <dd>
      <p>Each carrier has its own set of messages to say the same thing (Package scanned at the hub, Package delivered, Delivery attempt failed, etc.). We improved our internal mapping to allow more use cases for our notifications. For each notification, the brand could decide to display it on their tracking pages, send an email to the customer or to their internal users.</p>
    </dd>
    <dt>Integration of Looker</dt>
    <dd>
      <p><a href="https://looker.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Looker</a> is a Business Intelligence (<abbr title="Business Intelligence">BI</abbr>) tool, that we integrated inside Sendwise to allow our customers to build custom dashboards about their delivery data.</p>
    </dd>
    <dt>Carrier comparison</dt>
    <dd>
      <p>Allow a brand to analize which carrier is the best to deliver their products via various <abbr title="Key Performance Indicator">KPI</abbr> and filters.</p>
    </dd>
    <dt>Heat map to display delivery time from a warehouse</dt>
    <dd>
      <p>Visualize on a map the delivery time from a warehouse to any region in Europe. Brands can see via a color coding quickly in which regions, they are not performing well. This map was done with <a href="https://leafletjs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Leaflet</a> and <a href="https://gadm.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GADM</a> data sets.</p>

  <h3>Why I left Seven Senders</h3>
  <p>After more than a year at Seven Senders and after successfully lunched <a href="https://software.sevensenders.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sendwise</a> with my team for the <a href="https://k5.de/en/k5-conference/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">K5 2018</a>, I decided that I needed a new adventure with a bigger scope.</p>
  <p>At Seven Senders, I was working in the logistic industry. We provided tracking information about millions of parcels that our customers shipped to their customers.</p>
  <p>I needed a bigger stage, more complexity.</p>

      I have started 3 projects along the years that touch each an area of Basket-Ball.

        <dt>Basket Ball live stats</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>I played Basket-Ball between 8 and 18 years old, at youth high level in France. Taking the game statistics was left to the assistant coach and parents that knew how to take the. You needed to wait for the end of the game to know how well you played or how many turnovers your teams did in the game.</p>
          <p>I build a small app that allow anyone to take the statistics of a Basket-Ball game and share them in real time with the world. That way you do not need to wait for the end of the game to know how well your child did in the game or if your favorite local team is doing in their game when they play outside.</p>

        <dt>Basket Ball strategy</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>When a coach shared with us the game strategies and plays we will play in game, she/he used paper or whiteboard with step by step instructions and later real life repetitions on the court. You could only learn and train them during the practices.</p>
          <p>I wanted to build a tool for coach and players to share the strategies and plays, be able to see them in motion to understand faster how the play will be played.</p>
