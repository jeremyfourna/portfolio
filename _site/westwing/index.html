  <h3>Why I joined Westwing</h3>
  <p>My wife and I wanted to leave Paris <abbr title="France">🇫🇷</abbr> to get a bigger appartment.<br>I checked the offers in various cities, in France, London <abbr title="United Kingdom">🇬🇧</abbr> and Berlin <abbr title="Germany">🇩🇪</abbr>.</p>
  <p>I was really excited by the opportunity to work for Westing in their logistic division and mostly for they warehouse management system.<br>Plus living in Berlin <abbr title="Germany">🇩🇪</abbr> will be a huge plus.</p>

  <h3>What are my responsabilites at Westwing</h3>
  <p>I was in charge of the warehouse management system used most of Westwing warehouses. This software was inherited from Rocket Internet, then it was forked to match Westwing requirements.</p>

	<section class="features-projects-i-worked-on">
		
  <h4>Features & Projects I worked on</h4>
  <dl>
    <dt>Multiple warehouse support</dt>
    <dd>
      <p>Originally, the warehouse management system could only support 1 warehouse. All the orders that entered the system could only fulfilled by 1 warehouse. This implied that an external system will dispatch the orders to each warehouse management system.</p>
      <p>With this improvement, you can have mutiple warehouses being managed by a single warehouse management system.</p>
    </dd>
    <dt>Cost reduction and user productivity</dt>
    <dd>
      <p>We have dozens of workers inside our warehouses. Based on the data we collected, we could see which flows inside the warehouses were slow and needed some improvements. The improvements we were looking at were mostly refactoring existing features to remove all the useless steps or increase the performance of the software to allow the users to be faster in their tasks.</p>
    </dd>
    <dt>Travelling time of a picker</dt>
    <dd>
      <p>Our warehouses had multiple floors, so when you need to define a picking route for a picker, you must have the best heuristic algorithms to make their route as efficient as possible.</p>
      <p>I created a prototype to reduce the picking time by 20%, mostly inspired by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knot_theory" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the knot theory</a>  and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the travelling salesman problem</a>.</p>
    </dd>

  <h4>Work methods</h4>
  <p>My team consisted of 6 developers. We worked in Scrum mode with a sprint every week.</p>
  <p>I worked in full english (read/speak/write) with a multi-cultural team <abbr title="Germany">🇩🇪</abbr> <abbr title="India">🇮🇳</abbr> <abbr title="Poland">🇵🇱</abbr> <abbr title="Sri Lanka">🇱🇰</abbr> <abbr title="United States of America">🇺🇸</abbr> <abbr title="South Africa">🇿🇦</abbr> <abbr title="Hungary">🇭🇺</abbr> <abbr title="Macedonia">🇲🇰</abbr>.</p>

<section class="why-i-left">
	
  <h3>Why I left Westwing</h3>
  <p>To prepare Westwing stock market introduction, the company needed to reduce its costs, they decided to close the Berlin <abbr title="Germany">🇩🇪</abbr> office and bring back to Munich <abbr title="Germany">🇩🇪</abbr> some people from the Berlin office. I was fortuned to be part of this group of people. I turned the opportunity down because I just moved in Berlin 6 months ago and I did not want to move again to another city.</p>

      I have started 3 projects along the years that touch each an area of Basket-Ball.
      <dl>
        <dt>Basket Ball live stats</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>I played Basket-Ball between 8 and 18 years old, at youth high level in France. Taking the game statistics was left to the assistant coach and parents that knew how to take the. You needed to wait for the end of the game to know how well you played or how many turnovers your teams did in the game.</p>
          <p>I build a small app that allow anyone to take the statistics of a Basket-Ball game and share them in real time with the world. That way you do not need to wait for the end of the game to know how well your child did in the game or if your favorite local team is doing in their game when they play outside.</p>

        <dt>Basket Ball strategy</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>When a coach shared with us the game strategies and plays we will play in game, she/he used paper or whiteboard with step by step instructions and later real life repetitions on the court. You could only learn and train them during the practices.</p>
          <p>I wanted to build a tool for coach and players to share the strategies and plays, be able to see them in motion to understand faster how the play will be played.</p>
