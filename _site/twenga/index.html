  <h3>Why I left Twenga</h3>
  <p>Twenga suffered from a management problem. We had no clear direction, every week we were at the bar for a colleague farewell party... so the whole company vibe was that you should better find a new job soon because this is not the company you are looking to work for!</p>

    <summary>About Basket-Ball 🏀</summary>
    <div class="content">
      I have started 3 projects along the years that touch each an area of Basket-Ball.
      <dl>
        <dt>Basket Ball live stats</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>I played Basket-Ball between 8 and 18 years old, at youth high level in France. Taking the game statistics was left to the assistant coach and parents that knew how to take the. You needed to wait for the end of the game to know how well you played or how many turnovers your teams did in the game.</p>
          <p>I build a small app that allow anyone to take the statistics of a Basket-Ball game and share them in real time with the world. That way you do not need to wait for the end of the game to know how well your child did in the game or if your favorite local team is doing in their game when they play outside.</p>
          <p><a href="https://github.com/jeremyfourna/basket-live-stats">💻 Github repository</a></p>

        <dt>Basket Ball simulation game</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>This is an attempt to build a Basket-Ball simulation game.</p>
          <p><a href="https://github.com/jeremyfourna/basket-simulation-game">💻 Github repository</a></p>
        </dd>
        <dt>Basket Ball strategy</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>When a coach shared with us the game strategies and plays we will play in game, she/he used paper or whiteboard with step by step instructions and later real life repetitions on the court. You could only learn and train them during the practices.</p>
          <p>I wanted to build a tool for coach and players to share the strategies and plays, be able to see them in motion to understand faster how the play will be played.</p>

        <dd>
          <p>I probably own more than 300 mangas volumes. I read and buy more than 10 mangas at any given time. The problem when you enter the library is to remember at which volume you are currently!</p>
          <p>With this app, you can define for any mangas, which volume you own, so that in one glance you see which volume you should buy next.</p>
