        <dt>Product Management game</dt>
        <dd>
          <small>Started at Spryker</small>
          <p>This idea was born during our first product managers offsite in <time datetime="2018-11-20">November 2018</time>.<br>We were playing a product management card game but we were disappointed by the game quality, and we started mostly with {{ link.external("https://www.linkedin.com/in/brugger", "Simon Brugger") }} to imagine a better game targeted for product managers.</p>

          <small>Started at Spryker</small>
          <p>Take all the best practices and use cases of doing commerce at scale online and offline and try to boil them down to a big redesign/refactor.</p>

        <dt><abbr title="Database of Global Administrative Areas">GADM</abbr> GeoJSON</dt>
        <dd>
          <small>Started at Seven Senders</small>
          <p>With the library {{ link.external("https://mapshaper.org/", "Mapshaper") }} and {{ link.external("https://leafletjs.com/", "Leaflet") }} I wanted to build a tool that will concatenate all the shapefiles for a country and display them on a map. When you zoom in/out the administrative areas are loaded and displayed so that you get more details on the map.</p>

        <dd>
          <small>Started at Westwing</small>
          <p>I have been inspired by this article called {{ link.external("https://uxdesign.cc/design-better-data-tables-4ecc99d23356", "Design better data tables") }}. I tried to reproduce those best practices on a small <abbr title="JavaScript">JS</abbr> library.</p>

    <summary>About Basket-Ball üèÄ</summary>
    <div class="content">
      I have started 3 projects along the years that touch each an area of Basket-Ball.
      <dl>
        <dt>Basket Ball live stats</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>I played Basket-Ball between 8 and 18 years old, at youth high level in France. Taking the game statistics was left to the assistant coach and parents that knew how to take the. You needed to wait for the end of the game to know how well you played or how many turnovers your teams did in the game.</p>
          <p>I build a small app that allow anyone to take the statistics of a Basket-Ball game and share them in real time with the world. That way you do not need to wait for the end of the game to know how well your child did in the game or if your favorite local team is doing in their game when they play outside.</p>

        </dd>
        <dt>Basket Ball simulation game</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>This is an attempt to build a Basket-Ball simulation game.</p>
          <p>{{ link.gitHub("https://github.com/jeremyfourna/basket-simulation-game") }}</p>
        </dd>
        <dt>Basket Ball strategy</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>When a coach shared with us the game strategies and plays we will play in game, she/he used paper or whiteboard with step by step instructions and later real life repetitions on the court. You could only learn and train them during the practices.</p>
          <p>I wanted to build a tool for coach and players to share the strategies and plays, be able to see them in motion to understand faster how the play will be played.</p>

      Other projects I started when I felt myself creative.
      <dl>
        <dt>Ping Pong wars üèì</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>Track you Ping Pong games score inside championship to know who is the best at it.</p>

        <dt>Infinite dungeon</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>I wanted to create a browser based game that allow you to play indefinitely against monster. You could also grow your character via an infinite skill tree.</p>

        <dt>Money chart üí∞</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>Define your budget for the month and log what you paid each day, you will know how much you can spend each day for the rest of month.</p>

        <dt>Mangatek üìö</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>I probably own more than 300 mangas volumes. I read and buy more than 10 mangas at any given time. The problem when you enter the library is to remember at which volume you are currently!</p>
          <p>With this app, you can define for any mangas, which volume you own, so that in one glance you see which volume you should buy next.</p>
