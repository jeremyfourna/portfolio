                <p>I worked in full english (read/speak/write) with a multi-cultural team.</p>

            <h2>Why I left Seven Senders</h2>
            <p>After more than a year at <a href="../seven-senders/index.html">Seven Senders</a> and after successfully lunched <a href="https://software.sevensenders.com/" target="_blank">Sendwise</a> with my team for the <a href="https://k5.de/en/k5-conference/" target="_blank">K5 2018</a>, I decided that I needed a new adventure with a bigger scope.</p>
            <p>At Seven Senders, I was working in the logistic industry. We provided tracking information about millions of parcels that our customers shipped to their customers. The products were interesting but their scope were small and I thought that their potentials to grow where not big. I needed a bigger stage, more complexity.</p>
